# Airline Passenger Satisfaction
Team #27: Maryna Kostiuk, Ying Li, Yinglin Zhang, Tetiana Nurkanova


### Project Overview

Welcome to our second team project within Data Science Certificate. For this project we used the dataset [Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction). Within this project we will analyse data and answer such questions as: 
- What percentage of airline passengers are satisfied?
- Does satisfaction vary by customer type?
- What is the customer profile for a repeating airline passenger?
- Does flight distance affect customer preferences or flight patterns?
- Which factors contribute to customer satisfaction the most? What about dissatisfaction?
  
We hope that with the answers to this questions the airline company can improve the services and increase the satisfaction rate between customers. 


Unfortunately, the data source doesn't provide any information about the collection of data, sampling methods, and other details. We also couldn't find this information online. 


### Learning Outcomes
By the end of the team project, participants will be able to either:
* Create a data visualization as a team



### Team Approach
Our team collaborated extensively over Zoom meetings and over the Slack to ensure effective communication and a smooth workflow. The project was divided into four main parts, with each team member taking responsibility for one aspect of the project.

### Division of Responsibilities
