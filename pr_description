# PR description
This PR integrates the WHO Life Expectancy dataset into the project and introduces a regression analysis script. The script is designed to predict life expectancy based on various health and socio-economic indicators.

### Changes Made
- **2024-06-20**: Added the `Life_Expectancy_Data.csv` file in the `data/` directory.
- **Script**: Created `scripts/life_expectancy_regression.py` which includes:
  - Loading and cleaning the dataset.
  - Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  - Implementing a Linear Regression model to predict life expectancy.
  - Evaluating the model with performance metrics and visualization.

### How to Test
1. Ensure the dataset is located in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the `scripts/life_expectancy_regression.py` script.
3. Validate the model outputs by checking the generated evaluation metrics and plots.

### Checklist
- [x] Followed project coding standards and guidelines.
- [x] Documented all new additions and modifications.
- [x] Successfully ran all tests and ensured there are no errors.
- [x] Included plots to visualize the regression results.
